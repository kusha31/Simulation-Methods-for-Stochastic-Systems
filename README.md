# Simulation-Methods-for-Stochastic-Systems
Advanced statistical methods and algorithms like MCMC, EM can be found here.

Randomness and uncertainity are an integral part of nature e.g. random variations in weather patterns, human traffic, stock prices, etc. Stochastic models are important for characterizing such random phenomena. The goal of the topics mentioned in this repository is to examine different methods for simulating stochastic models. 

You can also find some test and tools for validating computer models of randomness.

All algorithms are implemented either in Python or MATLAB.
